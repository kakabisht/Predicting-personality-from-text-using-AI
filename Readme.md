This repository contains machine learning and deep learning algorithms used to predict personality of a person using text. The accuracy is not great,  as  the dataset is very imbalanced. As some personality types are more rare than other personality types such as ESFJ or ESTJ . Which causes it to be an overfitted model. Hence, the difference between training score and testing score is significant. 

Along with a FastAPI approach to talk with our model.
